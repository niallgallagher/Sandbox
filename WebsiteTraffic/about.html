					Gaelic games are a collection of traditional Irish sports deeply embedded in Irish culture. They include Gaelic football, hurling, camogie, and Gaelic handball. 
					These sports promote teamwork, sportsmanship, and respect for tradition.

				<h2>Rules and Guidelines of Gaelic Football </h2>
			</div>
						<p>
							1. Objective: The aim of Gaelic Football is to score points by getting the ball between the opponent's goalposts or into the net for a goal.
							<br>
							2. Teams: Each team consists of 15 players, with positions including goalkeeper, defenders, midfielders and forwards.
							<br>
							3. Ball: The game is played with a round football slightly larger than a soccer ball.	
							<br>
							4. Scoring: <br> 
   							 (I) A point is scored by kicking or punching the ball over the crossbar and between the goalposts. <br>
  							 (II) A goal, worth three points, is scored by kicking the ball into the net below the crossbar and above the goalkeeper's reach. 
							<br>
							 5. Duration: A typical Gaelic Football match consists of two halves, each lasting 30 to 35 minutes, depending on the level of play.
							<br>
							6. Tackling: Players can tackle opponents by using shoulder-to-shoulder contact, but tripping, pushing, or striking an opponent with the hand is not allowed.
							<br>
							7. Advancement: Players may carry the ball in their hands while running, bouncing it on the ground, or soloing (dropping and kicking it back to their hands). 
							They can also pass the ball by kicking or hand-passing it to teammates.
							<br>
							8. Fouls: Fouls result in free kicks, which can be taken directly at the goal or passed to a teammate. More serious infractions may lead to penalties or even player dismissals.

							<h2>Rules and Guidelines of Hurling </h2>
						
						</div>

						<p>
							1. Objective: Hurling is played with the objective of scoring points by hitting the sliotar (ball) over the opponent's crossbar or into the net for a goal.
							<br>
							2. Teams: Similar to Gaelic Football, hurling teams consist of 15 players, including a goalkeeper, defenders, midfielders, and forwards.
							<br>
							3. Ball and Equipment: The game is played with a small ball called a sliotar and a stick called a hurley. The hurley is used to strike the ball and to catch it.	
							<br>
							4. Scoring: <br> 
   							 (I) A point is scored by striking the sliotar over the crossbar and between the goalposts. <br>
  							 (II) A goal, worth three points, is scored by striking the sliotar into the net below the crossbar. 
							<br>
							 5. Duration: A standard hurling match typically consists of two halves, each lasting 30 to 35 minutes, depending on the level of play.
							<br>
							6. Tackling: Players can tackle opponents by shouldering or blocking, but using the hurley to strike an opponent's body is not allowed. 
							<br>
							7. Advancement: Players can carry the sliotar on the hurley for a maximum of four steps or balance it on the hurley while running. 
							They can also pass the sliotar to teammates by striking it with the hurley or by hand-passing.
							<br>
							8. Fouls: Fouls in hurling result in free pucks, which can be taken from the ground or from the hand, depending on the nature of the infraction. 
							Serious fouls can lead to penalties or player dismissals.
